# Personal AutoHotKey scripts for 2004Scape
Written for AHK v1.1

***
 
### launch-2004scape.ahk

Launches the game and all my scripts, moves and resizes the game window to my preference.

**This needs you to place an "lc-launcher.exe" shortcut in this folder**

*TODO: Make a config file for this*

***

### login.ahk

Autotype your login credentials with Alt+1

***

### mousecam.ahk

Middle click and move cursor to drag camera around

***

### runorb.ahk

Holds down the Control key for you (If you click to move while you're set to Walk in-game, you'll run instead).

*TODO: Make it draggable*
***

### wmk.ahk

Sets the 2 rows of keys above the arrow keys + the row of keys above the Return key to right click, move down 2/3/4 options, and left click.

*TODO: Give it a settings window to set your own keys*

***

**For each one of the previous scripts: click on the button with its initial letter to enable/disable it**

***

### tick-metronome.ahk

Helpful tick visualizer.

*Does not sync up with the game's actual ticks.*

***

**All of these scripts are made for, and stick to the standalone game client window**
